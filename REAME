PDF Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for answering questions based on the content of a PDF document.

-> How it Works

1. Document Processing: The PDF is parsed, and its text is split into manageable chunks. These chunks are embedded into a vector space using HuggingFace embeddings, facilitating efficient similarity search with FAISS.

2. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks of text from the PDF based on their similarity to the query.

3. Answer Generation: The retrieved chunks are provided as context to a powerful language model (Google Gemini). The model leverages this context to generate an informative answer to the user's query.
